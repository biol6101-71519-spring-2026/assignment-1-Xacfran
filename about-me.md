# About me 

My name is Francisco Castellanos and I am from Ecuador. I am interested in Genetics, Evolution and Ecology. While pursuing my PhD, I am implementing Machine Learning in retrophylogenomics to uncover intricate evolutionary histories in 
bat, bear, and butterfly lineages by using Transposable Elements as non-traditional molecular markers.
